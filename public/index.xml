      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;welcome&#34;&gt;Welcome!&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey! Howdy! Guten tag! おはようございます! My name is Kevin Mermelstein. I am an aspiring Cybersecurity Engineer. I am planning on using this blog to showcase my interests, current activities, and general thoughts about a host of various concepts, both related to cybersecurity and not.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;step-1-obsidian&#34;&gt;Step 1: Obsidian&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;hr&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;My first blog post is semi-documentation on my primary workflow process. My text editor for the posts are using Obsidian as a my primary note processor. It being both free and also modifiable helps me design and aesthetically pleasant experience with making markdown documents. I find markdown to not always be the most enjoyable in terms of designing charts or any visualizations, so using Obsidian helps. I will be updating this series with any additional posts that modify this workflow.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;who-am-i&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Who am I?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a fantastic question&amp;hellip; one that, not to get too deep, is something that constantly develops throughout ones life. Where I am today will already change by tomorrow. So I think the most honest thing I can do is to use this blog as a means to show that growth. As for my name, I am Kevin Mermelstein; an aspiring cybersecurity engineer. I generally go by Grimtexz online. I am a graduate from the Champlain College in Burlington Vermont, for my Bachelor&amp;rsquo;s of Science in Computer Forensics and Digital Investigations. I graduated Summe Cum Laude and have a few accolades for dean&amp;rsquo;s and president&amp;rsquo;s list awards. I have since, begun to transition from forensic specific skill development into DFIR skills, both including red team and blue team applications. I enjoy work with both SIEM environments and pen-testing.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
