# **Who am I?**

This is a fantastic question... one that, not to get too deep, is something that constantly develops throughout ones life. Where I am today will already change by tomorrow. So I think the most honest thing I can do is to use this blog as a means to show that growth. As for my name, I am Kevin Mermelstein; an aspiring cybersecurity engineer. I generally go by Grimtexz online. I am a graduate from the Champlain College in Burlington Vermont, for my Bachelor's of Science in Computer Forensics and Digital Investigations. I graduated Summe Cum Laude and have a few accolades for dean's and president's list awards. I have since, begun to transition from forensic specific skill development into DFIR skills, both including red team and blue team applications. I enjoy work with both SIEM environments and pen-testing.  

I, ultimately, am a learner at heart. Whether it be whitepapers, textbooks, YouTube videos, podcasts, or a puzzle that makes me bang my head against the proverbial wall, I love it. I think that is my largest passion in life; learning. I struggle like any other, but I live for those challenges. I live for the novelty of understanding something completely to scratch at my hyper-fixations. Whether it being learning a coding language, learning an foreign language, or learning about the life cycle of the Antennarius Striatus of the Antennariidae family. I am all about diving deep into a subject matter, acknowledging what I don't know, in order to grow what I do.

While I am a cybersecurity enthusiast, I like wear many hats. I have interests in D&D, improv, gaming, writing, poetry, languages, learning, music, conservationism, politics, philosophy... I am all over the map with my interests and I wouldn't change it for the world. ^.^
